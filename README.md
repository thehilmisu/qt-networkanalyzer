# Key Features

## Capture network packets in real-time.
Display packet details including source IP, destination IP, protocol, and length.
Packet Analysis:

## Analyze captured packets to extract meaningful information.
Detect and extract potential links (e.g., URLs) from the packet data.
Display the analysis in a user-friendly format.
Graphical Visualization:

## Plot packets on a time-based graph.
Display the source and destination IPs on the graph for each packet.
Dynamically update the graph in real-time as new packets are captured.

##User Interface:

Developed with a clean, user-friendly UI.
Implemented two different themes (GitHub Dark and Light) for the user interface.

# Potential Next Steps

## Exporting and Reporting:

Allow users to export captured data and analysis results to various formats (CSV, PDF).
Generate detailed reports with graphs and packet details.

## Advanced Filtering:

Add more advanced filtering options for packets, such as filtering by specific protocols or IP ranges.

## Session Management:

Implement session management to save and reload packet captures and analysis sessions.

## Enhanced Graphical Representation:

Introduce more advanced graph types and visualizations, such as histograms or pie charts showing protocol distribution.

## Customizable Dashboard:

Let users customize their dashboard layout and choose which elements (e.g., graphs, tables) are visible.

## Security Features:

Implement security analysis features to detect potential threats or anomalies in the network traffic.
